This repo contains the few-shot data we used in our paper *A Closer
Look at Few-Shot Crosslingual Transfer: The Choice of Shots Matters*.
There are 40 sets of K-shot, K = 1, 2, 4 (,8) data sampled from each
of the original dataset.


Note that for MLDoc we are not allowed to provide the actual corpus
due to licence restrictions
(cf. github.com/facebookresearch/MLDoc). We will provide the document
indices soon.

The pickle format of the data is available at:
